# code-during-jnu
#### it is just used to store my code like homework, exercise and practice from jnu.

### Update:

###### 2019, 11, 27

​		added QuickSort and Insertion Sort at CExercise/sort.

###### 2019, 11 ,22

​		added exp6Q1, exp6Q2 on CExercise. Q1 is a program for a very simple question, just ignore it. Q2 is a telephone directory program, it has four features like add, delete, find and modify your contact. Using C language compile.

###### 2019, 11, 21

​		added some java exercises and expriments in recent weeks.

###### 2019, 11, 13

​		added CExercise/exp5Q2. This experiment is about to find all pairs of vertex **MinPath**. Using Dynamic Programming----**Floyd Warshall Algorithm**   (**Introduction to algorithm P404**)

###### 2019, 11, 4

​		added some algorithm in graph field, such as **Min Path** and **Top Sort**.

###### 2019, 10, 22

​		update README for exp4Q2. It includes all my ideas when designing it.

###### 2019, 10, 20

​		exp4Q2 now optimize the huffman tree visualization. When Tree height larger than 4, it will work like a compressed style to visual huffman tree. Like this:

```c
                                *                                           
          /                                             \                       
         *                                               a                     
       /                     \                                                         
      *                       b                                                    
     /         \                                                                      
    *           c
   /   \
  *     d                                                          
 / \                                                                               
e   f 
```
It just let it flatter, more friendly^_^

​		More importantly, it supports analysing each character frequency in a text and generate a huffman tree with its code. And we can use that to encoding your text to something like '01010001'.

​		It means that you just no need to enter every char frequency on the console!!!! That is awesome, isn' it?

###### 2019, 10, 17

​		added .gitignore file to ignore files when c compiling generated.

###### 2019, 10, 16

​		/JAVAExercise has been upload some homework near this month. It's so simple, thus just ignore it ^ ^

​		/CExercise/exp4Q2 project now can encode your text to huffman code and decode it. You just tell what name the text file is and it will work. Ultimately, file will be stored in ./cmake-build-debug.

### Note:

​	It included a variety of study notes, which focused all my experiments and solutions about some bugs I met.
